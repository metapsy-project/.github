## Welcome to the Metapsy Project! 👋

### About ℹ️
---

Metapsy is a research project led by the VU University Amsterdam. The goal of Metapsy is to provide access to meta-analytic databases of clinical trials investigating the effect of psychological interventions (e.g. psychotherapy, preventive interventions, psychoeducation) on various mental disorders or mental health problems.

Data and software developed as part of the project is made publically available via the `metapsy-project` organization account, which you can find here.

### Repositories 📦
---

All meta-analytic datasets included in the project are released as separate repositories here on Github. The name of these repositores always starts with `data-`. Software developed as part of the project is also provided in repositories of this account; see e.g. [`metapsyData`](https://github.com/metapsy-project/metapsyData) or [`metapsyTools`](https://github.com/metapsy-project/metapsyTools).
